# What is this?

A JavaScript tech that uses D3 to make a timeline from a simple text file.  The timeline code is hosted on 
this repo - https://github.com/timelinez/timelinez.github.io/ - and served by by the good people at Github 
on https://timelinez.github.io/ and plucks a Github organization (or user) out of the anchor to pull a 
similarly served timeline out for presentation. Here's the reference one on JFK's presidency: 
[http://timelinez.github.io#timelinez/jfk](http://timelinez.github.io#timelinez/jfk).

# Making your own timeline

You're interested in hosting your own timeline, in which case take a look at 
[https://github.com/timelinez/jfk](https://github.com/timelinez/jfk) and make something similar. Editing 
your timeline can be done through Github's web interface. You can process your own contributions using 
GitHub's Pull-Request system.
